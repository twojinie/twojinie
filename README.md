# 👋 Hi, I'm Yijin Kim  

✨ *"I believe AI can solve meaningful problems when combined with domain knowledge."*  

🚀 AI & Data Enthusiast | Job Seeker in AI/Data Science  
I am an AI & Data Science enthusiast with experience **applying machine learning to diverse domains — from e-commerce to biomedical research.**
I thrive on designing **interpretable, generalizable, and practical AI models**, and I enjoy solving problems where **data is complex, sparse, or imbalanced.**

💡 My strength lies in:
- **Learning quickly** → from SQL & DB design to GNNs, LLM embeddings, and multimodal AI
- **Problem structuring** → defining tasks with real-world constraints (e.g., customer behavior, drug mechanisms)
- **Building explainable AI** → models that deliver insights behind data
- **Collaboration & communication** → bridging engineers, researchers, and domain experts through clear data insights

## Featured Projects & Research
- 🛒 [**E-commerce Product Return Prediction**](https://github.com/twojinie/E-commerce-Product-Return-Prediction)  
  - Built a **GraphSAGE-based model** on a heterogeneous graph (customers–orders–products), achieving higher accuracy/AUROC than baselines.
- 💊 [**Drug-Drug Interaction Type Prediction**](https://github.com/twojinie/DDI-prediction-using-various-encoders-classifiers)  
  - Explored multiple **GNN encoders (aprGCN, bprGCN, GAT)** and classifiers (MLP, K-way, self-attention) to predict interaction types, with **GAT-MLP achieving the best performance**.  
- 🍎 [**Your Personalized Food Recommender for Diseases**](https://github.com/twojinie/Your-Personalized-Food-Recommender-for-Diseases)  
  - Designed a **relational DB** by parsing data from multiple DBs and implemented **SQL** queries for evidence-based **recommendations**.
- 📑 **Ongoing M.S. Research**  
  - Developed interpretable Visible Neural Networks (VNNs) powered by LLM-pretrained models.
  - The model is designed to handle **highly imbalanced and sparse biological datasets**, aiming for **generalizable and robust therapeutic predictions**.
